# LINUX "OS" For ComputerCraft Minecraft mod.

Personal project in LUA.

An OS wrapper designed to look similar to Linux.

I included some programs that I coded with it


## HOW TO USE:

### Prerequisite : Minecraft | Forge/Fabric | CC Tweaked (Or an edited version of ComputerCraft, as the "pastebin" command is broken in the new version.).

### You need to setup an *Advanced Computer* for it to work.

In the command line of the computer. Type out:

"pastebin run https://pastebin.com/raw/9JHc5nuF"

"Install"

### Setup

You can run the command "user" to change your username.

Usage: User set [username] / user clear


You can also change the name of the computer using "label"

Usage: label set / label clear (more info using "label help")

### Getting started

You can run the command "help" for more help.
